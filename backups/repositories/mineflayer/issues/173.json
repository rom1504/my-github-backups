    "body": "Been updating mineflayer in order to bring 1.7 support (and to find bugs in node-minecraft-protocol 1.7). Currently, all the packet definitions in the plugins have been updated to use the packet name, and the fields were modified to reflect new names when they changed. All tests pass, but it's almost a guarantee that there is still a bunch of bugs left here and there. I'll be testing things left and right. \r\n\r\nBurger is currently broken with 1.7 and all. I'll try to fix it, but no guarantees can be made. \r\n\r\nAlso, note that the package.json currently uses git URL instead of version for node-minecraft-protocol due to changes not yet pushed to NPM. \r\n\r\nWhat needs fixing : \r\n- [x] Chat module parsing needs a lot of improvement. It should recursively parse the \"with\" and extras.\r\n- [x] Navigation is currently broken. It seems like the physics module isn't triggered at all.\r\n- [x] Bot is unable to respawn\r\n- ~~Sometimes, generally after teleporting, entities are removed from the entity list when they shouldn't be.~~ Moved to: #181\r\n\r\n(probably a lot more, list will grow as I find more bugs).\r\n\r\n3rd party states : \r\n- Navigate doesn't work.\r\n- Radar works partially, navigation doesn't work.\r\n\r\nDidn't test the rest, those are the top two priority for me, since they test the most essential part of the bot.\r\n\r\n----\r\n#### Issue Dependency Graph\r\n![Issue Dependency](http://i.imgur.com/pDySd9S.png)\r\n\r\nHas most the issues for the Stable 1.7 milestone, just to give some visual overview what needs to be done\r\n\r\n-NeverCast",
