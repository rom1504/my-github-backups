    "body": "This branch has various stuff that was needed to be added to MineFlayer in order to get it to work with Charged Miners.\r\n\r\nThe first commit wasn't really needed but is nice since core no longer links to X.\r\n\r\nThe second commit adds a Batcher which store all the callbacks and emit them at a single time, this was needed to not have to implement locking inside of Miners and work around the fact that the D GC needs to know about all threads that call into D code.\r\n\r\nThe third isn't ready to be pulled yet. The thing that makes this a massive hack is that I needed to fool Qt into thinking that the its CoreApplication was created in the Main thread by using pthreads, I guess something similar could be done on all platforms. But it would be better to massage Miners into having multiple OS backends (currently there is only one based on SDL).\r\n\r\nIn summary you can probably use the Fork Queue to cherry pick the first commit. I would also get a review on the second commit if I have done things the mineflayer way (code style, etc).\r\n\r\nCheers Jakob.",
