How are you using it?\r\nThere's a known problem with starting a tunnel in the open air. The cause is placing blocks doesn't wait to see if it worked; the bot moves right along looking for a place to place the next block against. In theory the bot should place the block on top of the block he placed just a moment ago, but since the server hasn't responded with a block change, he gives up. This isn't a problem underground because there's invariably an option to place the walls against. I'm not quite willing to slow down the whole process just to support starting a tunnel in the open air.\r\n\r\ncake_puncher.js is not meant to demo good coding practices; perhaps we should clean it up a little.\r\n\r\nThe inventory_test crash is news to me. I'll check it out when I get a chance.\r\n",
