    "body": "We all know having too much time is deadly. \r\n\r\nThis is a fix for #66 , 1.7 support for node-minecraft-protocol. Featuring a cool new chat client in the examples. \r\n\r\nMany thanks to @deathcap for fixing a couple things left and right (squashing commits made his name disappear :[)\r\n\r\nHere are some thoughts I had during the development of this patch : \r\nMinecraft protocol currently sends a lot of data as arrays, with a count prefix. Our current solution is to create a new parser for each array. It's a bit messy, and I think instead, we might as well create something along those lines : \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n0x01: [\r\n  { name: \"serverId\", type: \"string\" },\r\n  { name: \"countPublicKey\", type: \"short\" },\r\n  { name: \"publicKey\", type: \"byte\", count: \"countPublicKey\" },\r\n  { name: \"countVerifyToken\", type: \"short\" },\r\n  { name: \"verifyToken\", type: \"byte\", count: \"countVerifyToken\" }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe would still need a tiny bit of boilerplate (if type is byte, then output it as buffer instead of array) but it would be a lot less code, and much cleaner code, than what we have right now. It would allow complex structures to be easily parsable. Also, might need a container type.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n0x26: [\r\n  { name: \"columnCount\", type: \"short\" },\r\n  { name: \"dataCount\", type: \"int\" },\r\n  { name: \"skylight\", type: \"bool\" },\r\n  { name: \"data\", type: \"byte\", count: \"dataCount\" },\r\n  { name: \"meta\", type: \"array\", count: \"columnCount\", contents: [\r\n    { name: \"chunkX\", type: \"int\" },\r\n    { name: \"chunkZ\", type: \"int\" },\r\n    { name: \"bitMap\", type: \"short\" },\r\n    { name: \"addBitMap\", type: \"short\" }\r\n  ]}\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince right now, MC Protocol gives us the length-prefix, I thought it might be a good idea to do opportunistic parsing. Right now, every parser is ran for every packets, even if there are no listeners. I didn't code that in yet because... well... I thought about it a little late, but performance should jump straight up if we were to implement such a feature.\r\n\r\nCurrently, longs are stored in an array, since they are too big to fit in a JavaScript Number. I think it might be a good idea to instead use a BigNumber library to store them in. I know node-minecraft-protocol strives to stay a low-level implementation, but seriously, manipulating a long as an array is just a headache. Luckily the minecraft protocol doesn't use longs all that much. But for instance time updates, which uses them, are a headache to parse right now.",

As is, you made it so that future unknown packets are still handled correctly because of the prefixed length, yes?\r\n\r\n\r\n>  I think it might be a good idea to instead use a BigNumber library\r\n\r\nIs there a reason that if the API consumer of node-minecraft-protocol wanted to use a BigNumber library, they would have a hard time doing it?\r\n",
