It's just ridiculous, plus there is a lot of trial and error involved - If you install the dependencies in the wrong order it won't work. Usually I would keep my semi-rabid grumblings to myself, but today I saw this on URSA's page:\r\n\r\nNOTE: This package is no longer under active maintenance. If you would like to take ownership please contact Medium's Open Sourcerer.\r\n\r\nIs it time we try to move away from ursa? It seems to work fairly well, but the pain-in-the-ass setup on windows, and the unknown future of it, perhaps it's time to find something different? Or maybe I'm wrong, and ursa is the best / only RSA library for javanode. What do you guys think?\r\n",

So for the client, the perf impact is kinda negligeable (it takes about 50 times longer to connect, but it's justs for login, so it ain't too bad).\r\n\r\nFor the server, it's a different story. We can have multiple people logging in concurrently, and if we don't handle it properly, it will become a *HUGE* mess. So a proper and fast RSA library is necessary.\r\n\r\nWhat we should do is look for an efficient library that's both easy to use, install, and fast. I can see two possibilities : \r\n\r\n- URSA-like library that either statically links against the RSA library (so no more having to install a shitbunch of deps). The big problem is that NodeJS for Windows statically links OpenSSL, but it is impossible for native addons to take advantage of it, because... well, because windows. https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp/wiki/Linking-to-OpenSSL\r\n\r\n- Find a fast and reliable purejs library. I think we could find an asm.js-enabled library for rsa. For instance, [asmcrypto.js](https://github.com/vibornoff/asmcrypto.js). For those who don't know, asm.js is a subset of javascript that allows the JS engine to properly optimize the code. It's what allows unreal engine to run in firefox : https://www.unrealengine.com/html5/ ",
