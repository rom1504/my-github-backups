Is it ok to keep in memory the dead players ? Does that include the disconnected players ?\r\n\r\nAn other way to handle this issue would be to accept having unnamed player, but that break a lot of things and I'm not sure it can work ? Is https://github.com/andrewrk/mineflayer/blob/master/lib/plugins/entities.js#L348 sent at some point to give the username anyway ?",
