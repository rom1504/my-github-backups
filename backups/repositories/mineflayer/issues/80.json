On top of that we can emit events from these entities\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nbot.game.entities[\"123456\"].on('move', function(oldPos, newPos) {\r\n  bot.chat(\"STAY STILL\");\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nGetting a list of skeletons in the area for example or list of entities within X blocks becomes way easier when we already have a list being kept up to date instead of doing it ourselves. The event stuff might belong at a higher level though but I think the syntax is nice.\r\n",

I was thinking along the lines of:\r\n\r\nmove `bot.game.players` to `bot.players`.\r\n`bot.players['player_name'].entity`, which may be null if the player is not in range\r\n`bot.mobs[entityId]` which is an entity\r\n`bot.objects[entityId]` which is an entity\r\n\r\nor just `bot.entities` and you have to check the type.\r\n\r\nI do like the syntax you describe, but as you predicted, I think it may be too high level for mineflayer's goals.\r\n\r\nMy mind is not closed though. Maybe you could start another project where you depend on mineflayer and try out the higher level api stuff that you want, and we could kind of use that as a way to explore these concepts. Kind of like what [coco](https://github.com/satyr/coco/) is to coffee-script.\r\n\r\nAnyway, just a suggestion. I'll expose entities on bot before closing this issue.",
