Some version just wouldn't have some of the data files.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Related/ideas\r\n* database schema are usually split when putting it in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization#Normal_forms\r\n* knowledge bases avoid that problem by putting data in its atomic form : triples\r\n\r\nThe knowledge base way is close to what we are doing (for example `<1,name,stone>`)\r\nand it's even possible to convert all our data to a knowledge base forma (like n triples) by using json ld (http://json-ld.org/)\r\n\r\nAlso see http://wikiba.se/",
