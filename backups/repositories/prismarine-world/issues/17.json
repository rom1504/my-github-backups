            "body": "> annoying that the voxeljs api is sync https://github.com/maxogden/voxel-engine#requirevoxel-engineoptions\r\n\r\nIf by sync you mean the `generate` (or `generateVoxelChunk`) options, the alternative is to listen for `missingChunk` events then call `showChunk()` once they are generated, async example: https://github.com/voxel/voxel-land/blob/ee6e1283c606f6c31917ce999de2382058ddcefd/land.js#L122-L133 - this (superior, imho) method is the only one that works in the newer [voxel-engine-stackgl](https://github.com/voxel/voxel-engine-stackgl) currently (a port of voxel-engine using [stack.gl](http://stack.gl) instead of [threejs](http://threejs.org), and solves some inherent problems with the three.js approach, but does not yet have all the features of voxel-engine).\r\n\r\nIf there are other parts of the API that are sync and making integration difficult, would be happy to change them to async in voxel-engine-stackgl :) let me know\r\n\r\n> (on the browser visualization theme, this is interesting https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/thinkmap.413/, even though the java code won't be usable here ofc)\r\n\r\n[ThinkMap](https://github.com/thinkofdeath/ThinkMap) is pretty interesting, I contributed some bugfixes a while back, but development has stalled for a while. The server is written in Java, and the client also written in Java but compiles to JavaScript using [GWT](http://www.gwtproject.org/overview.html). \r\n\r\nI think https://github.com/vogonistic/mineflayer-voxel/pull/1 is currently the most promising. @vogonistic @rom1504 what do you about moving mineflayer-voxel into the https://github.com/PrismarineJS organization like https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer to maintain and develop it there? Would be awesome to get it up and running, actively developed again (it was before my time, I've never tried it until now). \r\n\r\nThe approach taken by mineflayer-voxel has some advantages over https://github.com/deathcap/voxel-clientmc - which is more ambitious in that it aims to implement an MC client as the web app itself, whereas mineflayer-voxel runs the \"client\" (via mineflayer) on a server and uses a simplified custom protocol for communication between the web app and client server. voxel-clientmc is further away from updating to get working again, currently blocked need to update [wsmc](https://github.com/deathcap/wsmc/issues/19) first.\r\n",

I never tested mineflayer-voxel when it was fully working, but I believe there are still things broken in https://github.com/vogonistic/mineflayer-voxel/pull/1 though.\r\n\r\nMy idea with having a prismarine-world voxel visualizer is that once it's done, it will be possible to use it along with a client (with mineflayer), or with a server directly (with flying-squid), or just load a world and use it without dealing with network problems.\r\nNow it's pretty much WIP because prismarine-world isn't used in mineflayer yet (https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer/issues/334) and the visualizer is not done at all, so it makes sense to try things in parallel with mineflayer-voxel / voxel-clientmc/... , the more working code the easier it get !",
