I think I might try putting them in a separate repo, what would be nice about that is treating these extractors as really a first class package, and doing things like automatically following the wiki changes and having that \"wiki watcher\" bot do PR to minecraft-data or something.\r\nI also thinks that extractors shouldn't be in a big \"all-minecraft-extractors-in-every-language-from-every-source\" repo, but instead just one repo by kind of extractor (for example burger is its own repo, [PocketBurger](https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketBurger/) too, and I think my wiki extractors should be in their own repo, and I guess a repo for the (small) decompiled extractor I did would make sense). That way everybody is free to make his own extractor in whatever language he likes from whatever source and PR his results to mcData.\r\n\r\nAbout a master branch : a possibility would be having everything but the data (the schema, the auto-testing, (possibly the extractors if they stay there), the readme) in master. And version branches would just contain the data (the .json files).\r\nIt would probably mean submoduling these version branches in master which has pros (no need to do this in each X-minecraft-data) and cons (need to update the submodule often to check the data fits the schema). Other ways than submoduling can be considered (in order to check the schemas for example).\r\n\r\nThe general idea here is to separate things that are independent and to do as little copy pasting (~= cherry-pick) as possible.",
