It would also be interesting to emit a \"newPlayer\" (player) server event, to allow external player plugins.\r\n\r\nAn other interesting thing about plugins would be to make some other kind of plugins, for example npc plugins which would be put at entity creation and would handle the action of the npc (/mob).\r\nThese new kind of plugins would be plugged in server plugins.\r\n\r\nWhen implementing NPC plugins, make sure that it makes more sense to create npc plugins vs just implementing the action and logic of npc in a server plugin directly (I guess it depends how much code would be needed for npc)",
