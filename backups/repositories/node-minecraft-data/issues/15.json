    "body": "https://github.com/PrismarineJS/node-minecraft-data/commit/f01605f88054105d89a7efb80371c0d0b7aa4c58 added protocolVersions support with the `versions` array and `versionsByMinecraftVersion` index, but looking up the version data by a protocol version would be useful in some situations. Note that since protocol version has two namespaces (usesNetty: true and usesNetty: false), there is protocol version overlap, but this could be solved by using negative integers for usesNetty: false and usesNetty: true.\r\n\r\nProposed use case: related ot https://github.com/PrismarineJS/node-minecraft-protocol/pull/330 Intra-release multi-protocol support. In node-minecraft-protocol, could allow the `version` options to be either:\r\n\r\n* typeof version === 'integer': use a version by protocol version integer (versionsByProtocolVersion index)\r\n* typeof version === 'string': use a version by minecraft release version string (versionsByMinecraftVersion index)\r\n\r\nBoth indexes would allow looking up majorVersion to map to the minecraft-data 'dataset' (1.8, 1.9...). The Minecraft release version string is more human-readable, suitable for custom client/app development, and the protocol version integer is more programmatically useful for automatically passing from the ping packet for https://github.com/PrismarineJS/node-minecraft-protocol/pull/331 dynamic cross-protocol support.\r\n\r\nThis index could be used in https://github.com/PrismarineJS/node-minecraft-data/issues/13 Update to use minecraft-data for toMajor(), so these would be equivalent:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n   require('minecraft-data')('1.8.9')\r\n   require('minecraft-data')(47)\r\n```\r\n\r\n(but accessing these indexes may require https://github.com/PrismarineJS/node-minecraft-data/issues/14 Lookup protocol data at top-level of module?)",
