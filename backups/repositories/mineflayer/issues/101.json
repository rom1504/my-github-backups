When we have a tool vs hardness calculation, we can replace the fixed value with something that is more correct. Especially for those cases.\r\n\r\nInitially I was going to trigger based on the blockUpdate that the bot gets when it breaks and even when it doesn't break, but I was getting two updates each time. Seemed like a big risk to always ignore the first and trigger off the second update since another player might cause another update to be sent between the first and the second.\r\n\r\nI'm aware of the imperfection in this solution, but I consider it a slight improvement.",
