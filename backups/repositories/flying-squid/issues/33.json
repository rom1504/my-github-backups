It should say pick next to it. Now, all the commits under it, instead of \"pick\"ing them, \"squash\" them. Save and quit the editor, git should do some work. Once it's done, `git push --force` and if you did everything right you should have a clean PR. If you did it wrong... that's where the backup copy comes handy ^^'",
