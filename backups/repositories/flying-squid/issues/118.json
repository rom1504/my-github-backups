For basic examples it would be nice to use strings:\r\n\r\n`\"Hello§1Red\"` or better yet `\"Hello\" + CHAT.RED + \"Red\"`\r\n\r\nSame with others colors, bold, italics, underline, cross-out, random, etc. This string would be converted to JSON for you.\r\n\r\nThen there comes more complicated things... Like something happens when you click on text or what text appears when you hover over text. This would most likely be done with JSON manually or something.",
