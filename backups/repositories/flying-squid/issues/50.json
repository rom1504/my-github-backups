[Something to do this](http://enclosejs.com/) exists however there are a few things to note:\r\n\r\n- [Look at the bottom](https://github.com/igorklopov/enclose/wiki/02.Packaging). We might need to do special stuff with FS and account for that!\r\n- Cross compilation is not supported\r\n\r\nSo ideally, something like auto-squid is running but instead of pulling and then putting a server up, it pulls, runs encloseJS, puts the compiled version in a different folder, and then pushes it to ANOTHER repo (so that github is hosting it, not us).\r\n\r\nSo yeah, if we wanted to do this, the biggest issues are the file system and, more importantly, cross compilation (unless mac servers exist or people are willing to host on a mac).\r\n\r\nThe main reason I'm talking about fs is because\r\n- It gets used in serverPlugins.js\r\n- The compiled version would need to access a \"plugins\" folder in the same folder.\r\n\r\nSo there might be a plugin that auto-compile-squid needs to add that would run external plugins from OUTSIDE the compiled version.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR It's not an emergency or anything but it would be cool to have and useful for 50% of our users**",
