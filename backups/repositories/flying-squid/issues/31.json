They can edit terrain but it will only be displayed locally.\r\n- Use /reset (or something) to reset all blocks (removes all local blocks).\r\n- Use /confirm to get a confirmation message for the latest block placed (e.g. \"Place block X at 5, 63, 4? Use /confirm yes/no\")\r\n- Using /confirm yes will \"place\" the block and all users will see it (and it will be saved to the world). The user will be kicked with the message \"Join back to spectate!\"\r\n- If you join and have already placed a block, you will be placed in a spectator mode. If you have been on for over 60 seconds and someone is trying to join, you will be kicked\r\n\r\nThe exact \"slot management\" system is rough since we only have 20 slots and I'm sure a LOT more people will be coming than that, however this should give a basic idea of what I'm trying to do.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR 3 minutes to place block, local editing until /reset or /confirm, join back to spectate temporarily**\r\n\r\n*I'm assuming the local place/destroy will be the hardest part of this*",

Maybe it would be interesting to emit a blockPlace event a little bit smarter than the raw block_place packet, but that's all.",
