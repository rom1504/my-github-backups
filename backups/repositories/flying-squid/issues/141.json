(Which is [bundled by default with the JDK?!?](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/scripting/programmer_guide/#jsengine))\r\n\r\nEcmascript API wise, it seems to me a little bit weird to have globals just there: `plugin()`, `command()`, etc. And anyways, our plugins currently are of a completely different structure, so there's little I can see that we could use.",
