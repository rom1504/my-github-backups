When an unknown entity is spawned, either because it was recently introduced in a new Minecraft update or because the entity type ID is used by a third-party mod, the bot crashes.\r\n\r\nAlso, is there an issue with PrismarineJS/minecraft-data or am I missing something? It seems that some entity IDs in [entities.json](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/minecraft-data/blob/master/enums/entities.json) are different from the ones reported [here](http://wiki.vg/Entities#Objects)\r\n\r\nIn my case the server sent a spawn_entity packet with type = 78, which should be an Armor Stand, but there are no entities with the same ID in that list, were some IDs changed in a protocol update?\r\n\r\nMaybe this should be a separate issue, though.\r\n",

What version of the minecraft server are you connecting to ?\r\nAnyway, the [wiki page](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Data_values/Entity_IDs) should be updated if some information on there are out dated.\r\n\r\nThere shouldn't be any entity for which we don't know the id so I'm not sure having a \"other\" entity type is a correct fix.
