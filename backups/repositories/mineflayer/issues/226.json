If all the lines are syntactically interchangeable, diffs are tidier, and reordering lines is easier. Over the last few years of maintaining dependency lists in package.json files, I've been burned by the necessary comma inconsistency at least 5 times. (I would add a line and forget to add a comma to the previous line, or I would reorder lines and forget to move the commas around independently.) This frustration is one of the motivations for https://github.com/andrewrk/liblaxjson .\r\n\r\nOn a similar note, I'd like to discuss this style:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar vec3 = require('vec3')\r\n  , assert = require('assert')\r\n  , zlib = require('zlib')\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy opinion is that this looks terrible. But opinions aside, this also seems functionally deficient, because the first line is different from the others. An independent problem is that the last line is missing a semicolon, which is technically not a problem, but it's a bit scary to rely on semicolon insertion.\r\n\r\nI propose this syntax instead:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar vec3 = require('vec3');\r\nvar assert = require('assert');\r\nvar zlib = require('zlib');\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis syntax is super normal, easy, consistent, etc. Why would anyone do anything else?",
