It sounds like you want to add some state to `createClient` which you should be able to do by adding some variables, right?",

            "body": "Alright, let's go from bottom up : \r\n\r\nI currently have a \"states\" object in protocol which is really just this : \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar states = {\r\n  \"HANDSHAKING\": \"handshaking\",\r\n  \"STATUS\": \"status\",\r\n  \"LOGIN\": \"login\",\r\n  \"PLAY\": \"play\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe idea is that people access the states via this object. Then, the packets object look like this : \r\n```javascript\r\nvar packets = {\r\n  \"handshaking\": {...},\r\n  \"status\": {...},\r\n  \"login\": {...},\r\n  \"play\": {...}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Originally I wanted to do states.HANDSHAKING as the key, but well... javascript syntax didn't allow me to do that. Oh well.)\r\n\r\nThe client then has a state, which is initialized at states.HANDSHAKING on creation. Upon receiving a packet, the client currently emits the following events : \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nself.emit([self.state, packet.id], packet);\r\nself.emit(packet.id, packet);\r\nself.emit('packet', packet);\r\n```\r\n\r\n(I thought the first emit wouldn't work because of the array, but a quick check in the REPL reveals it actually does)\r\nI kept the self.emit with packet.id for compatibility, but I don't know if it's useful. \r\n\r\nI also implemented the new login procedure (Yggdrasil) and separated it into it's own module, as I felt it was less awkward that way.\r\n\r\nI just pushed my current work to my branch so you can see it at https://github.com/roblabla/node-minecraft-protocol/tree/feature-mc1.7\r\n\r\nNow right now, I'm trying to pull my head around a weird bug where the TCP connection is abrupty ended after my client sends the first two packets. I expect the server to be replying to me with an encryption request, but it doesn't happen. I'm investigating with WireShark, comparing the data streams of vanilla client and my client. ",

I added the main ones now though, so you can grab the latest push and run it.

And nodejs' zlib library.\r\n\r\nAlso, added the state event to the client.

Reconnect to give yourself another chance.\"\r\n\r\nSo according to what I understand by reading around, you need to send position changes VERY often (like around every 50ms) during the movement. The server will send a response if your movement was impossible, in which case YOU NEED to send a new movement packet with THE SAME data, otherwise server ignores any future movement packets. If your movement was correct, the server won't give any response it seems.",
