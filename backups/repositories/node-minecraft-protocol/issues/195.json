My friend assured me that they weren't using the 'Spigot' server (I searched and it seemed someone else was having the same issues with them), but the messages I was receiving from server to client looked like Spigot's.\r\n\r\nThis just being an example, first one doesn't work, the second one does: \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nclient.on('chat', function(packet) {\r\n\tclient.write(0x03, {\r\n\t\tmessage: \"Hello world\"\r\n\t});\r\n});\r\n/***************************************/\r\nclient.on('chat', function(packet) {\r\n\tclient.write('chat', {\r\n\t\tmessage:\"Hello world\"\r\n\t});\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nI found this out on a previous example, the 'chat' event was replaced by 0x03, but now it's 'chat'. So I tried it with the write method and it worked. I don't know if the second would also work for anyone using a non-spigot server, but if it does would it make sense to change the examples?",
