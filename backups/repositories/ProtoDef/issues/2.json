    "body": "Anonymous containers get their fields written to/read from the parent container. This needs to be implemented on the \"readFields\" level, so that *every* type that returns an object can have their fields added to the parent. This would be especially useful for switch type. \r\n\r\nGiven a naive implementation of \"switch\" :\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar x = [{ name: \"mySwitch\", type: \"switch\", typeArgs: { field: { name: \"inner\", type: \"struct\", typeArgs: { fields: [\r\n  { name: 'one', type: 'int' },\r\n  { name: 'two', type: 'int' }\r\n]}}}}]\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo access the inner field, we would need to do ```packet.mySwitch.inner.one```. This is suboptimal at best. To avoid this problem, in the current implementation of switch, we copy all the fields of the given container into the body of the switch. However, it'd be nice if this could make automagically. Furthermore, it'd be even better if we could put mySwitch's fields into the parent structure directly, so accessing them would be as easy as ```packet.one```.",
