Their return values are modeled around 1.6 assumptions that do not hold true anymore. For instance, returning null if there is not enough data, even though since 1.7, not having enough data means there was an error in what the client sent, or an error in the protocol file.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, read returns not just the read value, but the read size. This leads to an incredibly convoluted API. Write and sizeOf has less problems.\r\n\r\nI think it would be in our best interest to rethink the read interface, lest we let the maintainers go :dizzy_face: !\r\n\r\nIt might also be a good idea to split the serializer into different files, similar to what is done in roblabla/Protocols",
