If accepted this project will also have to be enabled on https://travis-ci.org/repositories (log in with GitHub, go to repositories, turn on node-minecraft-protocol)\r\n\r\nThere was some previous discussion about Travis in https://github.com/PrismarineJS/node-minecraft-protocol/issues/30\r\n\r\nAs part of this PR I also disabled the client tests. Not sure if these are supposed to work, they fail for me (time out) both locally and on Travis-CI. If fixed they can easily be re-enabled but until then at least the 118 packet and mc-server tests run and pass.",

Only thing is, we're using circleci for the rest of the prismarinejs projects, so I think we'll be using it here too. \r\n\r\nAlso, we're planning on rewriting the whole test suite down the road to get rid of the java dependency (the idea is to use a bukkit plugin to generate a file full of valid packet, one with occasional invalid packets, and one with complete garbage data, and use this file as the testbed instead of the real server. I think I should make a new issue for this though.",
