If you don't care about colors, you can just try doing \"json.toString()\" to get the string of text. From that, you'll be able to use regex. Otherwise, you'll need to know exactly what each time of message contains so you can parse it manually.\r\n\r\nIf you have more questions, visit us in the gitter! (Link in the README)",
