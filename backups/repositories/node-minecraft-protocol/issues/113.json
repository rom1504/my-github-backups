    "body": "/summon @deathcap : this is mostly a question for you\r\n\r\nThe way WriteRaw and ReadRaw currently work, they can easily be misused, and they can very easily break at each new version of the protocol. This makes it very annoying to update.\r\n\r\nSo instead of just taking the buffer and naively writing it to the socket, I thought it'd be smarter to how make writeraw's buffer only contain packetId+data. writeRaw would then do the magic of appending the correct length/dataLength combo, compressing the buffer, encrypting the buffer, doing a voodoo dance around it and sacrifice a :sheep:.\r\n\r\nSimilarely, readRaw could return a buffer containing only the decompressed/decrypted packet with just packetId and the data (length of the packet can be checked with buffer.length). \r\n\r\nWould this suit your needs ?",
