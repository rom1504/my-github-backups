Based on burger.json from https://github.com/deathcap/Burger/tree/mc18 through `bin/generate_enums.java`, with the following caveats:\r\n\r\n* Removed biome.height - does anyone know what this was for? (http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Biome has no mention of a height property, the old pre-1.8 Burger had it but is not clear where in 1.8 the height comes from, if anywhere). In any case, nothing else seems to reference this value, I suspect it is fairly safe to remove.\r\n* Some of the temperatures and rainfall values were not specified in the constructors for some reason (couldn't get Burger to extract), so I used http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Biome and https://github.com/erich666/Mineways/blob/master/Win/biomes.cpp to fill in the gaps\r\n* \"Modified\" biomes (128 + original ID) are not included, these appear to be handled differently (highly dynamic, may need to be analyzed manually, or dumped at runtime)\r\n* Other enums not yet updated, will require more work to identify the structure for extraction (so far: https://gist.github.com/deathcap/6efd375e010a005040f8)",
