Mineflyaer javascript-engine provides a handlers for some gameplay events like \"onChat()\" or \"onHealthChanged()\" etc. Can you add a new event handler like a \"onEntityAttacked\", this event is called when one entity is attacking another (mob, player or self)? This event is helful to create an bots are strike if they are attacked, for example.\r\n\r\nRegards, Cr0s.\r\nP.S. Sorry for my bad english, I'am from Russian Federation.",

There is an animation event that happens when someone takes a swing at an entity, and there is an animation event that happens when an entity takes damage. When we get the animation event for taking a swing, and then very shortly after, the animation event for taking damage from an entity that is within attack distance, we can conclude that the first entity attacked the second. If it is ambiguous (two things attacking two things close to each other), we can use the direction that the attacker is pointing to disambiguate.\r\n\r\nThis is very much like how the logic works in our brains when we play the game, actually.",
