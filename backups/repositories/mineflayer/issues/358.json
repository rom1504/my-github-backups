Then now I can use `findBlock` to detect the `log` blocks. This is obviously not a very workable solution.\r\n\r\nAre you guys doing any kind of caching of blocks? Maybe the cache is not getting busted on the change?\r\n\r\nWhy would the bot not see the block change from `sapling` to a `log`?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n-- Arron",
