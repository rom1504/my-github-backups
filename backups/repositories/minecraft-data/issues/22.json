That means the data doesn't have to change if one index or an other becomes more pratical (id vs id:metadata vs name ,... ). It also makes it possible to consider one element as a document of a database.\r\n\r\nAll json files are now unindexed except for recipes and materials.\r\n\r\nI think materials could have a format like this : \r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"material\":\"rock\",\r\n  \"multipliers\":  {\r\n    \"257\": 6,\r\n    \"270\": 2,\r\n    \"274\": 4,\r\n    \"278\": 8,\r\n    \"285\": 12\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI'm not sure whether multipliers should be unindexed too since it only has one value, maybe.\r\n\r\nThe recipes file is currently indexed by output id. The simplest solution might be to just remove that indexing, and to say that the recipes should be ordered by a lexicographic order on (id,metadata) in order to have a decent diff.",
