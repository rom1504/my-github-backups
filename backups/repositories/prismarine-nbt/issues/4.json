Besides, mineflayer probably should expose a high-level API for the NBT, and probably should base it off this repo as well. There are a number of things we absolutely need to do though, if we're going down that road : \r\n\r\n1. Document this repository. This is fairly easy to do.\r\n2. Create a function that allows to \"flatten\" the parsed JSON down to something more akin to what nbt.js produces. The parser currently gives you a very weird structure like { type: \"string\", value: \"test\" }, instead of just \"test\", and that gets even worse in hierarchical structures.",

I had a masive career change and just haven't been able to focus on coding at all for the past year.\r\n\r\nThe improvements here are tremendous. I've taking the liberty of merging the changes back into [NBT.js](https://github.com/sjmulder/nbt-js). Apart from some formatting changes and small refactoring, I've made the writer a bit more flexible by adding seeking backwards and forward without destroying data. I've also added some documentation in the form of a changelog and an updated readme.\r\n\r\nMy own plans for NBT.js are as follolws:\r\n\r\n1. Migrate to newer JavaScript syntax for less crud and more clarity. Also more rigorous linting/static analysis. It's JavaScript after all.\r\n2. Browser support.\r\n\r\nAs for maintainership: it feels wasteful to me to have these two projects exist in parallel. prismarine-nbt, of course, exists to address a specific need for the Prismarine project. I'd happily incorporate any improvements for the benefit of that; then meanwhile you can benefit from general improvements to NBT.js. I'd happily give commit access too.\r\n\r\nIf you'd rather stick with your own repo for whatever reason - even if just to keep all the libs here together - then that's fine to of course. Might be worth checking out my patches and merging them back.",
