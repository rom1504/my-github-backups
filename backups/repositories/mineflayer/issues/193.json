Andrewrk is pretty busy, and this project has been nothing but a headache to update ever since 1.7.\r\n\r\nOnly @andrewrk can add new maintainers to the github and npm, I believe. While we wait for him, however, I'm already registered as a collaborator on both the github and npm, so please fork the project, update it, and create pull-requests. I can verify they work, accept them, and publish new versions to npm.\r\n\r\nmineflayer doesn't depend on a dead dependency, it depends on a dead software used to generate the objects, for instance in biome.js. The dependency is [Burger](https://github.com/mcdevs/Burger/tree/master) and [Hamburgular](https://github.com/sadimusi/Hamburglar). The biggest dependency of mineflayer, node-minecraft-protocol is still maintained (although it might be not up-to-date. I'll take a look and update it if it's not the case). \r\n\r\nThanks for reviving interest in this project btw, and good luck to you if you decide to fork and update it ^^. If you have any questions, I'm on IRC, irc.freenode.net, #mcdevs",
