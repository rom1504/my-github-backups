(see chest in http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Breaking#Blocks_by_hardness for example)\r\n\r\nI actually think that mineflayer algorithm to compute the digging time is correct (might be interesting to check that by computing a similar table than in http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Breaking#Blocks_by_hardness using that algo)  but it would be better to document that harvestTools means needed tools.\r\n\r\nAlso see http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/index.php?title=Template:Block&action=edit to understand better in which case a tool is required (=3.33 times penalty if not wearing it) or just better.",
