For example, /time has \"set\", \"add\", and \"query\" (although vanilla doesn't do it this way, it's just an example).\r\n\r\nIf a plugin, such as world edit, wanted to make a section /we, they would do:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nserv.newSection('we', {\r\n  help: 'World Edit Commands'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen it's easy to add commands. The section is dedicated by how the command is created. `time` means the section is the default section (i.e. ''), `we time` would mean it was section we> time, `we test time` would mean we > test > time, etc\r\n\r\n```js\r\nserv.newSection('we shape', ...);\r\nserv.addCommand('we shape sphere', ...);\r\nserv.addCommand('we shape cube', ...);\r\nserv.addCommand('we fill', ...);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, any section can contain both sub-sections or its own commands. Finally, help commands are automatically created for every single section in the format:\r\n\r\n/[section-list] <command> [page-n (optional)]\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n/[section-list] [page-n (optional)]",
