This isnt a major bug or issue, but as a suggestion was to make it where the protocols are stored in different libs and defined in the code with a version so it would look like\r\n\r\nvar mc = require('minecraft-protocol');\r\nvar client = mc.createClient({\r\n  host: \"localhost\",   // optional\r\n  port: 25565,         // optional\r\n  username: \"email@example.com\",\r\n  password: \"12345678\",\r\n  version: \"1.6.2\",\r\n});\r\n\r\nWhich could help alot.\r\n\r\nI may submit a PR to implement this",

For example you could create a node project called minecraft-protocol-x.y.z which depends on the correct version of minecraft-protocol for that xyz. You'd also have minecraft-protocol-x'.y'.z' which depends on a different version, etc. One package for each minecraft protocol version to support. Then you'd have a package minecraft-multi-protocol or something which depends on all your different xyz's. In that package you have a simple dispatch function which figures out which library to use based on the version argument.\r\n\r\nI'm not necessarily saying it's the best way to do it but 1) might be fun to try and 2) would allow minecraft-protocol project to ignore previous protocol versions safely.",

I just feel it would be more easier than to change to a different version.

So I specify in client/server or globally someting like:\r\n```js\r\nvar mc = require('minecraft-protocol');\r\nmc.proto_version = '1.7.9';\r\n```\r\nand in the lib there should be code something like:\r\n```js\r\nrequire('client.js') ;......; require('lib/protocol-'+this.proto_version+'.js');\r\n```\r\nIn big shortcut.\r\nIt will make many additional files, but they could be in subdir without any problem. And states or anything else will not confilct, because protocol itself it's in his file.\r\nIn my opinion it's easy to do and it will work. Even finding now files for each protocol in commits and adding them to subdir will take 15-20minutes and we will have support for all version accesible by one variable.",

            "body": "Except that won't work. The idea is good, but the old protocol files don't support named packets, so it's not going to work that easily. If we want to be *truly* compatible with all versions, we need to implement named packets in every protocol version.\r\n\r\nTo make things worse, the pipeline changed widely accross versiosn. Let me explain : \r\n\r\n- pre-1.3, the packets were in the format [byte packetId, byte[] packetData].\r\n- 1.3-1.7, the packets were in that format, but encrypted.\r\n- 1.7, the protocol was overhauled to be stateful. They also added varints everywhere, and added a length prefix. Packets effectively became [varint length, varint packetId, byte[] packetData].\r\n- 1.8, the protocol is changed to add compression.\r\n\r\nOh and as if that wasn't enough, the way login works changed as well, bringing another layer of disparity.\r\n\r\nBecause of these disparities, making everything work together is a *huge* pain in the ass.\r\n\r\nI'm currently working on making a *huge* change to this project, by splitting it into three smaller chunks that will be easier to work with.\r\n\r\n- The first is 'protocols', which is just a binary protocol (de)serializer. I hope this will allow me to bring a bunch of improvement to the binary parser, by splitting it from the minecraft world. Besides, it's also a handy tool in general ^^.\r\n\r\n- The second is 'minecraft-proto-def', which is both a minecraft protocol definition file for protocols, and an abstraction layer over the different minecraft functions. To put it simply, every protocol file will have a couple functions, such as \"pipeline\", \"login\", and of course the protocol definition. This way, less problems overall, and each minecraft protocol version will be easily self-documented.\r\n\r\n- The final project, 'node-minecraft-protocol', is what we currently know, but will contain protocol detection for the client, and version selection for the server. It will also be hopefully a bit faster, and a lot easier to maintain, since all the work will mostly be happening in minecraft-proto-def.\r\n\r\nDoing this gives us another benefit : it allows us to support projects like deathcap 's websocket minecraft port.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, this is taking a *lot* of time. I'm currently working on the biggest chunk of work, protocols. I've got most of the 'reading' part done, so what's mostly left is implementing the 'writing' part. Once that's done, I'll move on to creating the protocol files for 1.7.10 and 1.8. I can't give an exact time-frame, but I'll def keep this issue up-to-date with my progress.",
