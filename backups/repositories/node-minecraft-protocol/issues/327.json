Before initiating the connection, perform a ping to get the version and use it accordingly. `description`, `favicon`, and other fields could also be saved for consultation later.\r\n\r\nFML/Forge servers https://github.com/PrismarineJS/node-minecraft-protocol/issues/114 https://github.com/PrismarineJS/node-minecraft-protocol/pull/326 additionally contain more information:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n  \"modinfo\": {\r\n    \"type\": \"FML\",\r\n    \"modList\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"modid\": \"mcp\",\r\n        \"version\": \"9.18\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"modid\": \"FML\",\r\n        \"version\": \"8.0.99.99\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"modid\": \"Forge\",\r\n        \"version\": \"11.15.0.1715\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"modid\": \"IronChest\",\r\n        \"version\": \"6.0.121.768\"\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n(modinfo.type is also returned on [Glowstone++](https://github.com/GlowstonePlusPlus/GlowstonePlusPlus/commit/f95fd32b34388bbe789db2ce82edba6278286d35), 'BUKKIT' is a recognized type, to show the Bukkit logo in FML's server list screen. 'VANILLA' as well but not clear if anyone sends it.).\r\n\r\n`modList` is particularly useful because it gives the list of mods you must have in order to connect to the server. The FML|HS handshake protocol sends this list in the ModList packet, and if it doesn't match the server will kick the client, so the client would have to know it *a priori* unless retrieved from the Server List Ping. \r\n\r\n`createClient()` already does perform one pre-connect action: resolving DNS srv (_minecraft._tcp) records. ping.js doesn't do this, but it probably should (bug? anyone want to test?). Server List Ping would be another reasonable pre-connect step to perform, imho. Real clients usually show a server list before the player connects, so this would more closely match vanilla behavior as well.\r\n\r\nTherefore here's the changes I suggest:\r\n\r\n* Refactor DNS SRV resolution out of createClient.js, so ping() can use it standalone as well\r\n* Enhance createClient() to ping() (including DNS SRV) before connecting, by default\r\n* Optionally allow createClient() to skip pinging (option `ping: false`?), if desired; probably ought to also have `dns_srv: false` option to skip the pre-connect DNS resolution step. Some clients may want to skip these steps (and forgo the added benefits - no server description, automatic protocol negotiation, automatic Forge mod support), but I'd imagine most will want the useful default functionality",

Works in testing a 1.9 snapshot, 1.8.9, some third-party 1.8 server software, and a Forge 1.8.9 server, but has some rough edges:\r\n\r\n* Hardcodes knowledge of release versions and protocol versions, would be nice to get this from minecraft-data instead (protocolVersions.json added in https://github.com/deathcap/node-minecraft-protocol-forge)\r\n* Uses only the major release version (1.8, 1.9..), but client/server may have mismatched protocol versions, PR to NMP to allow specifying protocolVersion directly: https://github.com/PrismarineJS/node-minecraft-protocol/pull/330\r\n* Ping timeouts: not handled well, could fallback to a normal server connection if an error is received, but if the server is up but ignoring the ping then it'll wait indefinitely, separate bug https://github.com/PrismarineJS/node-minecraft-protocol/issues/329\r\n* Had to change the API of the wrapper, not compatible with `client = createClient()` because of the ping packet, made it async `createClientAsync(options, function(err, client)`\r\n* Forge support uses [node-minecraft-protocol-forge](https://github.com/deathcap/node-minecraft-protocol-forge), TBD how this support will fit in https://github.com/PrismarineJS/node-minecraft-protocol/pull/326\r\n\r\nI haven't published node-minecraft-protocol-auto to NPM, I still think it would be a worthwhile addition to node-minecraft-protocol itself. Maybe not in `createClient()`, but it could be a separate API available as an opt-in feature.",
