QLibrary does solve the dlopen vs LoadLibrary problem, but it doesn't solve the issue of plugins being able to access host code, such as calling functions of the Game object.

This is effectively solution 1 from the [link above](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7706592/can-i-access-to-symbols-of-the-host-proccess-from-a-shared-object-loaded-in-runt/7706994#7706994). This is not as simple a solution as the linux way because we'll need to duplicate any Game declarations in an IGame interface for plugins to be able to use them. The benefit of this is that it provides a nice layer of encapsulation in case we wanted to hide some core stuff from plugins.\r\n\r\n",

            "body": "My vote is Solution 2 below\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n1. Plugins must be in separate files (duh) like a .dll or .so. Static linking is not acceptable.\r\n2. Plugins must be able to interact with the javascript environment.\r\n3. Plugins must be able to call Game::blockAt, Game::getMapData, etc. without going through javascript.\r\n\r\n## Solution 1\r\n\r\nLink the executable with -rdynmaic/-export-dynamic. This allows plugins to access *all* the symbols of the host. Load the library using [QLibrary](http://doc.qt.nokia.com/latest/qlibrary.html#details) and call a single special function by name (such as \"mineflayer_plugin_init\"), and have the rest of the plugin accessible through the object returned by the function. This is currently working (except for the QLibrary part) in branch 'path' (at least commit 4d861ee5f8e0eddc724eab631d3202bebe52c625).\r\n\r\n### drawbacks\r\n\r\n-rdynmaic/-export-dynamic doesn't work in Windows.\r\n\r\n## Solution 2\r\n\r\nMake mineflayer a library with a minimal bootstrapping exe. Link plugins dynamically against the library (load-time linking) so that plugins can call code in the mineflayer library. Plugin loading and initialization would be the same as in solution 1.\r\n\r\n### drawbacks\r\n\r\nUgly organization.\r\n\r\n## Solution 3\r\n\r\nUse [QPluginLoader](http://doc.qt.nokia.com/latest/plugins-howto.html#the-lower-level-api-extending-qt-applications) to load plugins. Expose the interface of the Game class to plugins as purely virtual classes. Give plugins the object that implements the interface so that the plugin can call the functions of the Game class.\r\n\r\n### drawbacks\r\n\r\nBulky interface means expensive maintenance.\r\n",
