This PR doesn't include the world_particles (0x28 packet) sound effects, only 0x29 named_sound_effect, but they could be added later in this same plugin.\r\n\r\nKnown sound effect names: http://wiki.vg/Protocol#Sound_Effect (example: `mob.cow.say`, maybe could somehow include this list in https://github.com/PrismarineJS/minecraft-data but I'm not sure what data would be associated with it, if any - for now the name from the packet is passed directly through to the event).",
