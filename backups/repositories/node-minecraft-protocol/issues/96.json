If I understand this correctly\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction readPos(buf) {\r\n  var posNum = buf.readInt64();\r\n  var x = posNum >> 38;\r\n  var y = (posNum >> 26) & 0xFFF;\r\n  var z = (posNum << 38) >> 38;\r\n  return {x: x, y: y, z: z};\r\n}\r\nfunction writePos(value, buf) {\r\n  buf.writeInt64(((value.x & 0x3FFFFFF) << 38) | ((value.y & 0xFFF) << 26) | (value.z & 0x3FFFFFF));\r\n}\r\n```\r\nOr something like that, anyway.\r\n\r\n2. map_chunk_bulk... URG. Why the hell did they not send a goddamn size ?! I have a clever hack for this one, but it's too late at night for this one right now, so I'll see aobut it tomorrow. \r\n\r\n3. For world_particles, that's easy\r\n```javascript\r\nworld_particles: {id: 0x2a, fields: [\r\n  { name: \"particleId\", type: \"int\" },\r\n  { name: \"longDistance\", type: \"bool\"},\r\n  { name: \"x\", type: \"float\" },\r\n  { name: \"y\", type: \"float\" },\r\n  { name: \"z\", type: \"float\" },\r\n  { name: \"offsetX\", type: \"float\" },\r\n  { name: \"offsetY\", type: \"float\" },\r\n  { name: \"offsetZ\", type: \"float\" },\r\n  { name: \"particleData\", type: \"float\" },\r\n  { name: \"particles\", type: \"count\", typeArgs: { countFor: \"data\", type: \"int\" }},\r\n  { name: \"data\", type: \"array\", typeArgs: { type: \"varint\", count: \"particles\" }}\r\n]},\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. seems relatively straightforward, but will need a tiny bit of reworking the internals. I'll think about it tomorrow.\r\n\r\n5. So this one is going to need heavy use of conditionals. Urg. take a look at https://github.com/wtfaremyinitials/node-minecraft-protocol/blob/packets-1.8/lib/protocol.js#L486 for how conditional support works. I'll create the implementation tomorrow.\r\n\r\n6. NBTTags. Urgs. This one is going to abuse the same clever hack I'll use for maps (take the rest of the content from the packet, and feed it in an array)\r\n\r\nI'll try to get those I missed here tomorrow. ",

When js harmony comes out, we could prettify it with lambda functions tho.\r\n\r\n```map``` packet was easier than I thought: \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nmap: {id: 0x34, fields: [\r\n  { name: \"itemDamage\", type: \"varint\" },\r\n  { name: \"scale\", type: \"byte\" },\r\n  { name: \"iconLength\", type: \"count\", typeArgs: { type: \"varint\", countFor: \"icons\" } },\r\n  { name: \"icons\", type: \"array\", typeArgs: { count: \"iconLength\", type: \"container\", typeArgs: { fields: [\r\n    { name: \"directionAndType\", type: \"byte\" }, // Yeah... that will do\r\n    { name: \"x\", type: \"byte\" },\r\n    { name: \"y\", type: \"byte\" }\r\n  ]}}},\r\n  { name: \"columns\", type: \"byte\" },\r\n  { name: \"rows\", type: \"byte\", condition: function(field_values) {\r\n    return field_values[\"columns\"] !== 0;\r\n  }},\r\n  { name: \"x\", type: \"byte\", condition: function(field_values) {\r\n    return field_values[\"columns\"] !== 0;\r\n  }},\r\n  { name: \"y\", type: \"byte\", condition: function(field_values) {\r\n    return field_values[\"columns\"] !== 0;\r\n  }},\r\n  { name: \"dataLength\", type: \"count\", typeArgs: { countFor: \"data\", type: \"varint\" }, condition: function(field_values) {\r\n    return field_values[\"columns\"] !== 0;\r\n  }},\r\n  { name: \"data\", type: \"buffer\", typeArgs: { count: \"dataLength\" }, condition: function(field_values) {\r\n    return field_values[\"columns\"] !== 0;\r\n  }},\r\n]},\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo only ```map_chunk_bulk``` and ```update_nbt_tag``` left. So this is where the \"clever hack\" comes in.  We create a new data type, the restBuffer : \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction readRestBuffer(buffer, offset, typeArgs, rootNode) {\r\n  return {\r\n    value: buffer.slice(offset),\r\n    size: buffer.length - offset\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar writeRestBuffer = writeBuffer;\r\nvar sizeOfRestBuffer = sizeOfBuffer;\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou have the right to say \"ewww\". This is, indeed, an ugly hack. It relies on the fact that the buffer will always contain exactly one packet.\r\n\r\nThen, ```map_chunk_bulk``` can be implemented like so : \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nmap_chunk_bulk: {id: 0x26, fields: [\r\n  { name: \"skyLightSent\", type: \"bool\" },\r\n  { name: \"chunkColumnCount\", type: \"count\", typeArgs: { type: \"varint\", countFor: \"meta\" } },\r\n  { name: \"meta\", type: \"array\", typeArgs: { count: \"chunkColumnCount\",\r\n    type: \"container\", typeArgs: { fields: [\r\n    { name: \"x\", type: \"int\" },\r\n    { name: \"z\", type: \"int\" },\r\n    { name: \"bitMap\", type: \"ushort\" },\r\n  ]}}}\r\n  { name: \"data\", type: \"restBuffer\" }\r\n]}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd finally, ```nbt_update_tag``` : \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nupdate_entity_nbt: { id: 0x49, fields: [\r\n  { name: \"entityId\", type: \"varint\" },\r\n  { name: \"tag\", type: \"restBuffer\"}\r\n]}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd with this, the protocol should be 100% updated :D\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate it if you could integrate the changes I gave you here properly in the source code and do a PR on github. I'll review it and accept it when it's done :)",

When trying to encode something in a 64 bit int/long, we are getting to numbers so high that the fact that all numbers in JS are floats becomes a problem. I assume that's why writeLong currently takes an array of two numbers. I'm not sure how we should go about fixing that.\r\n\r\nAlso, Happy New Year to both of you!",
