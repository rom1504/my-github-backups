It's just something I did in an hour and in no way is it polished (it makes it's own OP system and allows anybody to op themselves!). I'd be happy to put it in it's own repo when we have a final external-plugin design so I don't have to keep making changes myself.\r\n- At the moment, external plugins do not differ between player and server. Most plugins won't need server (such as WG) but in certain cases, when they do need it...\r\n\r\nPlayer plugin:\r\n```js\r\nmodule.exports = inject; // playerInject\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlayer/Server plugin:\r\n```js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  player: playerInject,\r\n  server: serverInject\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nServer plugin:\r\n```js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  server: inject // serverInject\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhy? Because nobody wants to turn their 20 line plugin into 2 plugins because it has a serv.on() somewhere.\r\n\r\nIn addition, \"this\" cannot be used. I have recently thought of this. That is because:\r\n```js\r\n// somewhere inside the inject method\r\nconsole.log(this); // The plugin! W00t!\r\nconsole.log(self); // ^^ Same\r\nplayer.on('placeBlock', function(e, cancelled) {\r\n  console.log(this); // The player! Nooooo!\r\n  console.log(self); // Still the plugin!\r\n});\r\n```",
