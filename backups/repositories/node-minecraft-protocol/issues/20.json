However, at any place I could get away with *not* understanding the actual game protocol, I did.\r\n\r\nEven if you want to be nice and send the kick packet, you still want to be able to forcefully end the connection. This module lets you do both. If you want to send the kick packet, use\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclient.write(0xff, {reason: \"client.disconnect\"});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to forcefully end the connection, use `client.end()`.\r\n\r\nThis is a wontfix.",
