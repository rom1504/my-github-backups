    "body": "The current model of digging sends a start digging packet, immediately followed by a finish digging packet, then waits for a block update packet to find out when the digging was completed. For most blocks a block update is immediately sent to counteract the \"finish digging\" packet, which mineflayer ignores, and then another block update is sent with block type air, which mineflayer takes to indicate that the digging has completed.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there are exceptions. For example, sometimes when you dig leaves, you get the first block update, but not the second.\r\n\r\nThe only way to solve this problem completely is to solve #107 \r\n\r\nThis model of digging would look like this: Send a start digging packet. Wait the appropriate amount of time. Send a finished digging packet. Assume that the digging worked.\r\n\r\nIt's so sad - we *must* assume that digging worked. The server does not verify that your digging was successful.\r\n\r\nWe could wait for a short timeout after digging to see if the server sends an update block which would tell us whether the digging worked or not, but then digging is slower than it could be.",

It sucks that we have to assume digging works, but at least we'll be no worse off than the Notchian client.\r\n\r\nI remember bots being able to dig extremely fast in the past, and the current method is much slower than it could be.",
