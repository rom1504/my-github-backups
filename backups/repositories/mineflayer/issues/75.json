I want to make a bot that stands around PvP and when a player gets close enough to attack another player (6 blocks) it will say watch out X is trying to kill you.\r\n\r\nI have this working with my radar plugin - just wanted your opinion before I add it to Entity and send a pull req",

Like you suggested before, you can use `bot.use('radar')` to inject the extra into your bot.\r\n\r\n2. separate project\r\n\r\n  Installation would look something like `require('mineflayer-radar')(bot)`.\r\n\r\n  The benefits of this are:\r\n * you can version lock the separate project to the correct version of mineflayer\r\n * I, as the maintainer of mineflayer, do not become responsible for maintaining all the code that would have been in extras/\r\n * the plugin can have additional npm dependencies without requiring mineflayer itself to depend on them\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, I will expose all the classes on mineflayer in the next release, such as Entity, Block, etc. so if you want to add properties / methods to these classes you can.",
