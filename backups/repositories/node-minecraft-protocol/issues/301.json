But this is pretty ugly.\r\nA better solution would be either changing \r\n1. the packet name : wiki.vg names it player_position but protolib does seem to be naming it [position](https://github.com/dmulloy2/ProtocolLib/blob/master/ProtocolLib/src/main/java/com/comphenix/protocol/PacketType.java#L118)\r\n2. the type name : that type is not exposed in any API, so we could change it. Maybe to pos.\r\n\r\nI guess changing the type to pos is probably the best way.",
