It may be assumed that `setWindowItems:0` is a \"private event\" since it's not in the API docs, but It's an encapsulation leak to allow even the possibility of client's thinking that listening to `setWindowItems:0` is how they are supposed to listen for inventory updates. I know there are a lot of different users of mineflayer out there, and having a list of all of them to search for \"setWindowItems:\" would put my mind at ease.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I'm being too pedantic about trying not to break the API users' code.",
