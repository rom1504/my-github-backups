    "body": "A note on typeArgs and fields and stuff : Protocols doesn't define typeArgs at all. Types in protocols come in three different flavors :\r\n\r\n- A full object, in which case it looks like { type: \"name\", someArgs: ..., someOtherArg: ... }\r\n- An array, in which case it is syntax sugar for { type: \"struct\", fields: the given array }\r\n- A string, which is syntax sugar for { type: \"given string\" }\r\n\r\nThe read function takes a buffer+cursor, a type and a context. The name isn't going to be used by the generic _readField anymore. It is currently only used to augment error types. Instead of dealing with that in _readField, it seems smarter to delegate that work to the different containers. As such, name will just be a normal argument for type struct.\r\n\r\nThis is linked to #2",
