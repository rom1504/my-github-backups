Additionally, forge servers aren't going to consider going any higher(1.8) until sponge is finished, due to cauldron being abandoned, which is going to be a while.\r\n  - Last time I checked, the documentation is rather poor, especially for the earlier protocols back when they had the \"just look at the source code\" mentality.\r\n  - It's worth noting that it took a fair bit of effort to get bungee to support forge, if I remember correctly, there was an unknown packet 4 that was causing a lot of issues. which leads to the next point.\r\n  - Some mods are unpredictable, and some have tried implementing their own protocols, which can lead to unpredictable results. Whilst this isn't really an issue for a chatbot that can ignore these random packets, its worth considering.\r\n\r\nAnyway, just thought I might weigh in, I'll keep tabs and lemme know if you need anything ;)",

I'm quite used to reading decompiled minecraft source by now :smile:.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem you mention here is the mods reserving their own protocol packets (which is stupid, since they should be using custom_payload packet). However, that doesn't really matter, since I believe node-minecraft-protocol ignores unknown packets (this is actually an undefined behavior that's a side-effect of an optimization I made. Heh. Should standardize this). So unless the mod involved does really weird stuff with the protocol, we should be alright.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, those packets which have added info can be supported by injecting their own packets through the same way I'll inject forge's packet. Though again, if mods do this, they're doing it wrong. ",
