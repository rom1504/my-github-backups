How to reproduce:\r\n1: Take digger.js, make it dig to the side.\r\n2: Have it dig the block\r\n3: Replace the block using another client, cobblestone generator, etc\r\n4: Have it dig the block again\r\nExpected: Bot will dig the block in the same spot as the last one\r\nWhat happens: Bot says cannot dig\r\n\r\nIf you put some console.logs in Blockupdate in blocks.js, and on target in digger.js, you can see the the block the bot digs has different coords than the update that blockupdate() sees *Dispite the update comes from minding that block*!!\r\n\r\nhttp://pastebin.com/tLRRavqW\r\n\r\nEDIT: More testing shows this is only when WATER is next to the block being broken Tested with flowing water, before and after adding it: http://pastebin.com/T929W9jz",
