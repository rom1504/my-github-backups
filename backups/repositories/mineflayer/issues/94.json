But that's incorrect information, and so is saying that the block above a fence has an air boundingBox.\r\n\r\nIf we're going to make the navigator correct, then the navigator will just need to do the logic you just removed from blockAt everytime blockAt is called. This doesn't make the navigator faster at all. And the physics engine will need to do the check as well, so it doesn't help there either.\r\n\r\nThis speed improvement is only valid for callers that don't care about the boundingBox property, like searching the world for diamond ore, or something. Perhaps the boundingBox correction could be enabled with an optional blockAt parameter. Perhaps only fill in the boundingBox property if we do the extra work to make sure it's correct, otherwise leave it undefined.\r\n\r\nOut of curiosity, how did you measure the speed? The navigator? What was the speedup?",
