If we are going to use protocol.json to produce something like wiki.vg/Protocol, we need to either take wiki.vg names, either push ProtocolLib names to wiki.vg. An other way might be to keep different names for every packet, but I'm not sure that's a great idea.\r\n\r\nYeah indeed there are some discrepancies in field names that should be fixed (like gamemode vs gameMode)\r\n\r\nIt's not a big problem from the generator side : I actually already fixed that by having a id to ProtocolLib names converter. I mean it's not a technical problem. Also the main point of my wiki generator is to be able to see the difference between the wiki and our protocol.json : to see if some types are wrong for example. The second thing I want to use it for is getting field notes into protocol.json. I'm almost there.\r\n\r\nIn a second time, that generator should be rendered useless by going the other way (protocol.json to something like wiki.vg/Protocol)",

Do you think we should handle this kind of discussion differently ?\r\n\r\nThe problem I have with this issue in particular is that, to my eyes, minecraft-data should try its best to only contain data contained from the minecraft jar itself. Packet names and field names are something that don't really exist within the minecraft jar, so we must make a source authoritive. There are at least 5 different name sources I can think of (Bukkit, MCP, wiki.vg, ProtocolLib, obfuscated minecraft.jar). Out of all those, wiki.vg is arguably the 'worst choice', being changeable accross wiki edit (I don't know if this ever happened, but I would guess it already happened, and will continue to happen, since it's just a wiki).\r\n\r\nI also fail to see how not using wiki.vg names poses a big barrier. The names are sufficiently close for the not-too-stupid user to figure out which is which. When I switched NMP to use named packets instead of IDs, all the parties involved at the time (including a few of the library's user) agreed ProtocolLib names were a smarter choice. The people using ProtocolLib in their Bukkit Plugins don't mind not being able to use the wiki.vg names either.",

            "body": "@nickelpro the problem with this is, take a look at what happened in 1.9 : every packet changed ID, because someone at mojang thought it'd be a fun idea to sort them by their internal, private, not-publicly-accessible names. Packet names and field names provide a small layer of abstraction that allows implementors to not have to worry about these details : we garantee that even if the ID changes, so long as the packet name is the same, the packet has the same semantic meaning across proto versions.\r\n\r\nAlso, you are free not to use the name fields, if they annoy you. They're already pretty much optional, if you think of it this way. fields are put in an array to keep order. We didn't do the same for packets in an attempt to keep the diff small, but if the community thinks we should transform the packets into lists instead of hashes, I guess we could do that.",
