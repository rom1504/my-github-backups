Was trying to use this column data in https://github.com/deathcap/voxel-clientmc/issues/5 but, of course, it incompatibly changed in 1.8â€¦\r\n\r\nMaybe a chunk class as part of the public API would be useful. Calling blockAt for every position in the chunk is a lot of overhead (it was the main bottleneck in voxel-clientmc, had to call it anyways to convert 16x16x256 chunks to 16x16x16, slow enough it required its own web worker), and writing a custom map_chunk packet listener locks in clients to a specific protocol version. No easy answer..",
