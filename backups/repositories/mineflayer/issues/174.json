This causes an illegal stance if you're successfully connected, or prevents you from successfully connecting if you don't send a correct packet to begin with.\r\n\r\nThe reason that the 1.7 bot was unable to navigate was because of this check on the server:\r\nhttps://github.com/Bukkit/mc-dev/blob/master/net/minecraft/server/PlayerConnection.java#L94-L99\r\n\r\nBecause the stance was not correct the y axis didn't match what the server told us, so the server was never marking us as 'ready'\r\n(Still at loading screen state is assumed when CheckPosition is false)\r\n\r\nCurrently navigation is working in the 1.7 feature branch on my repo, which is currently PR'd to @roblabla (https://github.com/roblabla/mineflayer/pull/2) so that it can be part of the PR to this repo. (https://github.com/andrewrk/mineflayer/pull/173)\r\n\r\nThe only reason I put this issue here is to bring attention to this issue and open discussion about how we should fix it.\r\n\r\nLines of concern regarding the current fix are here: https://github.com/nevercast/mineflayer/blob/feature-1.7/lib/plugins/physics.js#L328-L339",

Also research in to how the bounding boxes work in the physics engine need to be looked at. Example, the bot can stand on top of the door. The Notchian client will fall in to the gap, another thing is that the Notchian client pushes the player out of blocks since many versions ago, if you're trapped in glass (Which will not suffocate you), the client will try push you out of it.",
