I guess it's about craft again ?\r\nIf not maybe try giving me the crash log\r\n\r\noh yeah about compatibilty with bukkit, some works is currently being done in mineflayer to make it work,  see this https://github.com/superjoe30/mineflayer/issues/159\r\n\r\nI guess when the problem is solved in mineflayer, I'll just update to the next version of mineflayer and it'll work hopefully",
