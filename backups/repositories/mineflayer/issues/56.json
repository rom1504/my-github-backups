As quoted by \"To some extent, you won't have to implement the mods directly, but at least send the packet that Forge wants to let it work? shrug\"\r\n\r\nAKA.\r\nMinecraftForge mod on server sends packet to mineflayer requesting for mods x, y and z, which are necessary to join.\r\nMineflayer responds request by falsifying a succeeded packet, repeats for each requested mod.\r\n(If mineflayer does not send back successful packet, kicked by server)\r\nAfter all requested mod check packets are completed, and all are successful, JOINed!",
