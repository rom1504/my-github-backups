I don't really know why I'm getting updates from the blocks that far away. But it happens consistently. I'll keep investigating.\r\n\r\nWhen I test the block at  { x: -98, y: 123, z: 539 } again in a few seconds I get air. When it should be cobble.",

I get the air to cobble update, but it's in the wrong location. I've also noticed discrepancies in coordinates when I have the bot output my player's current position. So if it's not minecraft's derpy protocol, it might be some minor error under a couple layers of stuff in mineflayer. \r\n\r\nI'm hoping that the voxel.js plugin will help out in visualizing just what the bot is seeing in combination with some packet sniffing of minecraft I might find something. I'll keep you posted if I find anything. Thanks for this awesome library.",
