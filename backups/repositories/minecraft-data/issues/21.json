Does that mean that \"data provider\" should still be in this repo and other language users would just not use them or should there be a \"node-minecraft-data\" repo that would depend on this repo and provide these indexer and all ?\r\n\r\nI also thought about simply putting that provider inside mineflayer, but the thing is minecraft-data will be used by projects not using mineflayer (see https://github.com/PrismarineJS/prismarine-server/issues/23)\r\n\r\nThe advantage of a node-minecraft-data provider is would provide an example of how to read the data, so that other people using other languages could do that kind of providers too if they want (for example a python-minecraft-data )\r\n\r\nWhat do you think ?",
