It has two blocks in the update, both wooden doors (64), stacked on top of eachother, with metadatas 5 and 13. This makes me think this is related to Issue #11.\r\n\r\nReproduce this problem by running a bot for a while (at least 10 seconds). and then opening/closing a wooden door. Then maybe it will happen. I wonder if it's a race condition.",
