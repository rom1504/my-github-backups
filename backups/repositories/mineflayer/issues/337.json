    "body": "Warning: huge rookie to this, but I'm having a lot of fun!\r\n\r\nAs it is right now, I have a node.js script that logs me onto a server. However, I would like the bot to attack a player. The player is directly infront of them, and I'm not sure if it's possible to send \"clicks\" through node, and if not I'm trying to use the attack method. Here is my code so far:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nbot.on('login', function() {\r\n\tconsole.log('Logged into [server]!');\r\n\tbot.attack(entity);\r\n});\r\n\r\nfunction nearestEntity(entities)\r\n{\r\n\tvar r=entities.reduce(function(acc,entity)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tvar d=entity.position.distanceTo(bot.entity.position);\r\n\t\tif(d<acc[1])\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tacc[0]=entity;\r\n\t\t\tacc[1]=d;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\treturn acc;\r\n\t},[null,1000000]);\r\n\treturn r[0];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe nearestEntity function was suggested from rom1508, but I don't think I understand the concept of it, or how the entity is defined. Any help/suggestions are much appreciated!",
