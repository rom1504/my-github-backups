I am not sure what you refer to when you speak of 'hijacked' standalone bots.\n\nI personally still see this project as in the baby stages as far as how good the library is.  Most of the examples are full of re-usable bits of code (camel, cook, eat, equip, etc), but I agree that there should be an easier version of 'examples' for users.\n\nThe lib/ folder is currently for a library just to make sense of some of the C++ stuff and very basics (e.g. finding blocks, metadata, etc), while the examples/ folder is for a mix of general purpose and highly specific stuff (equip/use vs hater_bot/defender).",
