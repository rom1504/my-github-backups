That's a pretty good place to start, but I'll expect we'll need a lot more changes before we can really be 1.8-ready. Mainly, the enums will require some love, and I expect a lot of breakage in the different example.\r\n\r\nIs this ready for merging, or do you plan on working on it more @deathcap ? ",
