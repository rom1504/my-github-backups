(pull out your `rsa-wrap.js` into a new module, to allow browser-based substitution?). Additionally the `superagent` module has trouble with loading `mime`, attempts to call `fs.readFileSync(file, 'ascii')' which is not available in browserify (and not covered by [brfs](http://npmjs.com/package/brfs) - it only can replace fixed file paths), not sure what is going on there since [superagent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/superagent) is advertised as supporting both Node.js and the browser (with the same API).\r\n\r\nThe original change in this pull request (only exposing `lib/protocol.js` in the browser, not pulling in any other dependencies) still works. Could this be merged in the meantime until the other features of node-minecraft-protocol (yggdrasil authentication, using superagent; protocol encryption, using ursa; etc.) are made to work the browser (if ever)? I only really am interested in the packet decoding/encoding.\r\n\r\n(Tested against the packets-1.8 branch)",
