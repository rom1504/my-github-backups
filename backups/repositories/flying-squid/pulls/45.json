Superflat.js would simply set module.exports instead of \"var SuperFlat\".\r\n\r\nchunkSeed uses https://www.npmjs.com/package/random-seed\r\n\r\nThat means you can do stuff like chunkSeed.random(), chunkSeed.range(0, 100), and other stuff in that package. The chunk should generate exactly the same every time unless you run Math.random(). <3 seeds!\r\n\r\nI presume we'll make a /gens folder soon for some defaults we want to throw around (and maybe event default generation!)",
