I'm pretty sure it was due to lag since I only noticed this when connecting the bot to a distant server and not to localhost.\r\n\r\nBasically I think the bot keep sending position update (moving forward for example) but the server get them only a few seconds later so in the vanilla client you only get them a few seconds later too, so it appears it's teleporting.\r\n\r\nI think we should somehow check the latence and adapt physics.js accordingly.",
