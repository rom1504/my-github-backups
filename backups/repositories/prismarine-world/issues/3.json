Mineflayer has a `columns` thing, not sure exactly what it contains.\r\n\r\nWhat should prismarine-world store ? an array of chunks ? by what should it be indexed ?\r\n\r\nWe need #2 to be possible.\r\n\r\nMaybe the first step should be defining the API that's needed, and then we can decide what's the best way to provide stuff to make that API work.
