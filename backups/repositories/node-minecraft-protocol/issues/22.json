It would be pretty easy to return an object with an `error` property if there was a problem, and then bubble that up into `parsePacket`. Then in client.js if `parsePacket` returns an error, you could gracefully emit an error and unhook the relevant event listeners.\r\n\r\nIf you like I can create a branch and skeleton this out, and then all you'd have to do is update the parse functions, returning an error instead of crashing.\r\n\r\n",
