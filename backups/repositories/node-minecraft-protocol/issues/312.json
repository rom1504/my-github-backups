On one hand, there is an argument for keeping NMP small and minimal, allowing other modules to build on top of it. On the other hand, having built-in WS support could greatly help ease WS/MC adoption - meaning that, for example, someone writing a client/server/proxy with NMP could trivially interoperate with WS client/server/proxies.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/feross/webtorrent faces a similar problem: they have implemented bittorrent in the browser, but cannot interoperate with peers only supporting the original native TCP/UDP BT protocol. So they are advocating other bittorrent software (even native apps) adopt browser support so they can talk to each other (WebRTC in their case, but it is analogous to WebSockets in this project).",

The most generic API that NMP could expose is a plain Node.js `Stream`, which is compatible with websocket-stream, duplexer, websocket-stream, etc. (I use all these for various purposes, so a built-in ws stream would only be marginally useful). I first passed this in through `options.stream`, but @rom1504 has a point, callers can just use `client.setSocket()` - updated https://github.com/PrismarineJS/node-minecraft-protocol/pull/320 accordingly. \r\n\r\n#320 factors out all of the TCP-specific stuff into a separate file (DNS SRV lookup, net.connect, encryption/authentication/yggdrasil), this way WS clients (or other non-TCP clients — WebRTC P2P?) can use NMP without this baggage.\r\n\r\nThe remaining problem is disabling framing — cleanly —, #320 has a hack by setting the framer to an empty stream, not sure of the best way to do this.
