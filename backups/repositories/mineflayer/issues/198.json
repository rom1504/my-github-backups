I see that it hasn't been updated in a year, and of course stuff is breaking every which way. I was (and still am) a coder and wanted to try and write bots for Minecraft. I gave up after searching for a week, and a few months ago I decided \"why not dive into the protocol itself?\". I got some stuff working which was nice, but since I had no idea what I was doing, I copied the mineflayer A* pathfinding because I was NOT going to write one myself. I important that, and I need the biome file. Okay, add that. Oh, and the biome list. Okay, added. Oh, and the block file, the block types, the block lists, etc etc etc GAAHH!\r\n\r\nAnyway, I get everything imported and it (for the most part) worked. Manually making collisions was a fun time (bot kept getting kicked for flying on servers or what not). Haven't played Minecraft in a month or two (I go in phases between TF2 and Minecraft. It's been a long TF2 now) and I keep getting these emails about mineflayer. For the past month of getting these, I thought it was different project which was a \"programmable bot\" but it was in java as a mod. Just today I realized what it was.\r\n\r\nAnd it's being updated for 1.8.3\r\n\r\nYou suck, now I have to get back into Minecraft.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nDemiPixel\r\n\r\nP.S. \"Create Minecraft bots with a powerful, stable, and high level JavaScript API. Note: This project is no longer maintained.\" Is that gonna change?",
