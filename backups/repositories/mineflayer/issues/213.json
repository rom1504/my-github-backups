From trying to log into a specific server (obviously needs more testing), I found that there was a player_info missing. I got:\r\n\r\nItem:  { UUID: [ 527226816, 3711314700, 2790224496, 2516429248 ],\r\n  gamemode: 0 }   (search for 'player_info' event in plugins/entities.js)\r\n\r\nThe action was 1, therefore updating the gamemode (we don't do anything yet) of a player who we never got an action 0 for (new player). This meant by the time it got to receiving the named_entity_spawn, it tried to set the entity of a player we never created.\r\n\r\nThe protocol says player_info is ALWAYS sent before named_entity_spawn. What's happening? And if we can't fix it, should we just create a nameless player? ",
