New Minecraft protocol indicates that a JSON should be sent with \"translate\" \"color\" \"using\" and more fields, but my server only sent \"text\" field, so in the chat.js the code tried to look for \"using\" and that fields and it crashed. So I used directly Node-MinecraftProtocol and ignored those fields getting only text field.\r\n\r\nI dont know if this works like that with all the servers or it just mine, If I can I will try to use it on a Vanilla Server and tell you what is happening. Btw I recommend you to check your chat code if you want maybe because I dont think my server is so modified (Specially because I coded so I know what is modified) and maybe the client will crash with many other servers :S \r\n \r\nThank you for everything again, really good project !\r\n",

            "body": "Update:\r\n\r\nI have investigated a bit. It seems that not all CHAT PACKETS must have all the JSON fields (\"using\", \"text\", \"translate\")\r\nFor example, when someone says hello on a server, the server send a Chat Packet to all users with only the TEXT field Ex: { text: \"[Admin][Notch] Hello Guys\" }\r\n\r\nBut, for example, when a user dies, the server send this packet:\r\n\r\n'{\"translate\":\"death.attack.generic\",\"using\":[\"boti\"]}' }\r\n\r\nThat is translated by the client to: Boti died.\r\n\r\nBefore last update all packets were translated by the server and sent as a String, now some packets should be translated by the client. So I think, you should add to your code a \"If(JsonMsg.translate!=null)\" and similar to \"using\" and other fields to check if the field exists before using a function with a null field=exception\r\n\r\nI hope I could help, sorry for my fatal English, Its not my native language as you have seen xD\r\n",

After getting the latest revision, there isn't a crash anymore, but the examples that use the 'chat' event don't work either. I've figured out why - my craftbukkit server has a plugin called 'Essentials', which does a number of things - firstly, it prepends a tilde to operators' nicknames, and the world name in brackets as well (so the regular expression from chat.js:19 needs to have the caret removed for the match to work, and then you need to manually remove the tilde from the resulting nickname). An example would be '[world]<~poopy> hello' (also colored btw); secondly, it allows for nicknames - so if you are using a nickname (for example your username might be poopybiscuits1629 and your nick can be biscuits), there seems to be no way of identifying a relation between the username and the nickname. If you're running the node bot on the same filesystem as the mc server, you could read the per-user data in craftbukkit/plugins/Essentials/userdata/poopybiscuits1629.yml, but I believe at this point the code is getting too complex to stuff into the chat.js plugin. Perhaps the furthest it could go is to allow an array of aliases, and let the user write his own code (perhaps a library) for getting the data to fill that array, or just hardcode it. Or, even more generally, allow the chat plugin to use a specified parsing function for the JSON or just the chat string. These last few options might simplify it greatly, but the examples won't work. Perhaps you could add a throw() in the chat.js plugin that says 'I can't figure out who sent this message and I can't really parse it properly. Please write your own parser. See this page for more information (insert url to a wiki page explaining the wonderful varieties of chat message flavors).\"\r\n\r\n",
