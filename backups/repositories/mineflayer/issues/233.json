For example, the reported progress in https://github.com/andrewrk/mineflayer/issues/180 indicates support for the above.\r\n\r\nIf you try to run the vanilla `minecraft_server.1.8.3.jar`, many things don't work anymore, such as opening chests. This issue is to keep the minecraft_server support caught up.\r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n\r\n * activating a chest block doesn't get an Open Window response. (see https://github.com/andrewrk/mineflayer/pull/166#issuecomment-84721979 )\r\n * Any change to the world isn't noticed by bots. (try the digger example)",
