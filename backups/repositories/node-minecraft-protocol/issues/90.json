Looking at the code, we're sending keepalive packets right after the login procedure is finished, AKA when the player entered the \"Play\" phase, so I don't see this being an issue. You could try de-activating the keepalive entirely, see if you can login at all. \r\n\r\nI'll investigate some more.",

I think the client is casting the login to a play when it receives the kick packet because it expects it when it is in Play stage (which the server is in, but sometimes the client is still in Login and probably made easier to break by it all being on localhost). Delaying with the sleep allows the client some time to switch to Play before getting the packet and it works fine",
