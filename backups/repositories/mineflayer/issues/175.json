    "body": "Currently, chat support is, IMO, broken. The current implementation kind-of works on vanilla minecraft, but doesn't work any kind of third-party chat systems, and there is no documentation about how to make it work, if possible at all.\r\n\r\nAs such, we need to modularize chat entirely. I propose removing chat.js entirely, and instead reworking it into a module system similar to #165. \r\n\r\nEssecially, we need to define three things : \r\n\r\n- Our own ChatMessage \"class\", which would work similarely to minecraft's, without the translation bit. It would have a toString method to return the raw string without any kind of color codes and a sender property to recover the sender.\r\n- A ChatBase \"interface\", that defines convertMessage(string) and returns a ChatMessage. It also defines and implements a function, stringTojson (silly name, I know), that would transform the old format codes (those with the paragraph signs) into the equivalent proper json message as sent by newer servers. \r\n- A default chat implementation, that works on vanilla servers.\r\n\r\nI think we don't need to actually provide support for any other chat systems, community will provide them as needed. It's not complicated to write one anyway. \r\n\r\nI'll start working on a PR to implement this tomorrow.\r\n\r\n@nevercast ",

I'm the one who did the old #165 PR and the [#chat-plugins](https://github.com/andrewrk/mineflayer/tree/chat-plugins) branch was also mine (it is the same code).\r\n\r\nThat code is old and I don't it will work as it is. Not to mention that it seems it was not the best solution. I think I was not very inspired at that moment. Also, I think that parsing the old (*non-JSON*) format no longer makes sense.\r\n\r\nTo avoid falling into the same error and seeing that it can be tricky or difficult to implement, I recommend starting by defining the exact API changes and how would be an ideal chat plugin example.",
