Only a few ES6 features are missing from Node 5, and all that NMP would currently need, as far as I can tell, is transform-es2015-destructuring (comparable to --harmony_destructuring) and transform-es2015-parameters (comparable to --harmony_default_parameters).\r\n\r\nBabel's transform-es2015-destructuring is also more complete than Node v5.4.1's --harmony_destructuring, which annoyingly does not yet support destructuring assignments outside of variable declarations (hence https://github.com/deathcap/node-minecraft-protocol/commit/17f4c65cdfd8c3c43a5181a2dd0593bc99d30744 - Node errors out on `({ a, b } = c)`, even though it is legal ES6 syntax, destructuring support is incomplete/in-progress. On the other hand, `let { a, b } = c` works).\r\n\r\n> Now idk if we want to use only es-current or also es-next as we currently do.\r\n\r\nI'd be inclined to favor only es-current (or less), since using es-next introduces additional fragility and risk by depending on experimental features that could change at any time. Keeping up with the moving target of the MC protocol is already difficult enough =) the increased burden of tracking ES7 changes also adds to the maintenance cost.\r\n\r\nI think the only ES7 feature NMP relies on is class field declarations: https://github.com/deathcap/node-minecraft-protocol/commit/aa722ab3af14ee20d84612718c88760f9a6599af - or is there anything else? Looks like the currently-ES7-based NMP could be ported to ES6-only without too much trouble, if this change is desired. @roblabla @wtfaremyinitials what do you think? My 2Â¢, while ES7 has some neat experimental features, relying on them has a cost which ought to be carefully considered, especially for a library depended on by other projects. I could PR the ES7-removal separately if there is interest.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere's also the potential benefit to consider of removing the added complexity of using babel, gulp, and a build process in NMP. I haven't tracked it down fully, but I've been seeing some strange issues with source maps in projects using NMP (ref https://github.com/deathcap/wsmc/issues/16) - which I haven't seen when NMP is removed, or with projects using babel through the [babelify](https://github.com/babel/babelify) browserify transform instead of a gulp build task. Not to say these issues can't or shouldn't be investigated fixed, but removing additional build tasks reduces complexity and leaves fewer opportunity for issues to arise (kiss principle), less to go wrong and bugs to track down.",

NPM cares very little about the problems surrounding this (https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/3055 is still open, years after the fact), sourcemaps are not supported natively (have to use source-map-support, which is up to the API consumer, not library author, to avoid conflicts), etc...\r\n\r\nBesides, es7 is still too far off and is only marginally useful to us (I mostly use decorators, initialisers, and async/await). Async/await has a few very real problem (async generators are still not a thing) making building abstractions on top of it not viable for our use-case, I don't think we'd use decorators, and initialisers are not worth an extra build step.\r\n\r\nSo yeah.
