I think the reason is that the bot does not switch tools in time to place the torch.  Instead, the bot digs the bot, switches to the torch, the gravel falls, and the bot gets stuck until rebooted.\r\n\r\nI suspect that the cause is the combined time of the wait (to avoid the top block staying in place), along with a slow tool-switching operation, though I am not sure how the code is implemented yet..  I have on my todo list to take a look at the builder library's code.",
